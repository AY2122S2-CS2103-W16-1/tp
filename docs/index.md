**UniBook is a desktop application for students that provides an all-in-one platform for them to communicate with professors and other students taking the same modules.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using UniBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing UniBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
